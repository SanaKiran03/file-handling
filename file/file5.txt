Uthman ibn Affan :

Uthman ibn Affan's reign (644â€“656) was undoubtedly one of the most formative in this tumultuous period. Born in the Hijaz (Arabia) into an Umayyad family in the Quraysh clan, Uthman was a companion of the Prophet. He was already in his mid-sixties when he was elected third caliph.
